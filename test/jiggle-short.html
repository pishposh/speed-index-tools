    <p>   <b>One</b> <b>Art</b>

    <p>   The art of losing isn’t hard to master;
    <br>  so many things seem filled with the intent
    <br>  to be lost that their loss is no disaster.

    <p>   Lose something every day. Accept the fluster
    <br>  of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.
    <br>  The art of losing isn’t hard to master.

    <p>   Then practice losing farther, losing faster:
    <br>  places, and names, and where it was you meant
    <br>  to travel. None of these will bring disaster.

    <p>   I lost my mother’s watch. And look! my last, or
    <br>  next-to-last, of three loved houses went.
    <br>  The art of losing isn’t hard to master.

    <p>   I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,
    <br>  some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.
    <br>  I miss them, but it wasn’t a disaster.

    <p>   —Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture
    <br>  I love) I shan’t have lied. It’s evident
    <br>  the art of losing’s not too hard to master
    <br>  though it may look like (<i>Write</i> it!) like disaster.
